# Java Programs for CISCE Board (2023-2025)

This repository contains Java programs written by **Aaryan Ved Bhalla** from **2023 to 2025** as part of the **CISCE Board syllabus**. These programs cover various concepts of Java programming, including object-oriented principles, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## üè´ Topics Covered
- **Basic Java**
- **Conditionals & Loops**
- **Functions & Recursion**
- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, etc.)**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Many programs contain package declarations**
   - Several Java files have **package names** since they were written in an **IDE (BlueJ)**.
   - You may need to **modify/remove the package declarations** depending on how you run the programs.

2. **No Scanner objects have been closed**
   - Any `Scanner` object used in these programs has **not been closed** (`scanner.close();` is missing).
   - This was done to avoid potential runtime errors in different execution environments.
